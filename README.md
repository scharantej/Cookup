## Flask Application Design for Recipe Maker

### HTML Files

1. **index.html**: The main page where users can input their list of ingredients and submit them to generate a recipe.
   - Contains a form with an input field for each ingredient and a submit button.

2. **results.html**: Displays the recipe generated using the user's ingredients.
   - Includes the title of the recipe, a list of ingredients with their quantities, and instructions for preparing the dish.

### Routes

1. **route_index**: The route for the main page (`/`).
   - Renders the `index.html` file.

2. **route_results**: The route for the results page (`/results`).
   - Accepts a list of ingredients as input from the user.
   - Generates a recipe using the ingredients provided.
   - Renders the `results.html` file, displaying the recipe.

3. **route_api**: An API endpoint to generate and get recipe data, rather than rendering a page (`/api/v1/recipe`).
   - Accepts a list of ingredients as input in JSON format.
   - Generates a recipe using the ingredients provided.
   - Returns the recipe data in JSON format.

## Conclusion
The Flask application designed here enables users to input their ingredients and generate a recipe using those ingredients. It features an easy-to-use interface for both input and output, making it user-friendly and efficient for recipe generation.
